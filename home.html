<p> With HomeKit, Apple devices have a standardized way to configure, communicate with, and control "the internet of things", 
including connected lights, speakers, scales, security systems, and more. You can even group actions together and trigger them using Siri, Apple's virtual personal assistant.   </p>
HomeKit is a framework for communicating with and controlling connected accessories in a user’s home. You can enable users to discover HomeKit accessories in their home and configure them, or you can create actions to control those devices. Users can group actions together and trigger them using Siri.                                                                                                            </p>
<p> Apple wants to streamline home automation.
In other words: it wants to make it easier for smart accessories to communicate, and for you to connect and manage all the smart accessories in your home from various manufacturers (such as Philips Hue lights, Wink lights, and other speakers, thermostats, detectors, plugs, blinds, locks, sensors, etc). HomeKit is basically Apple’s framework for home automation. </p>

<p> Manufacturers can implement HomeKit into their smart accessories. It was first announced at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in 2014. The name is a combination of “home” for home automation and “kit” for software developer kit. HomeKit-enabled accessories are secure, easy to use, and work with several Apple devices (including iPhone and Apple TV).</p>



<p> Apple's HomeKit turns the iPhone into a remote for your smart home. Apple wants to make the smart home a whole lot smarter. With a feature called HomeKit that's coming in iOS 8, iPhones will be able to start controlling smart devices, such as garage door openers, lights, and security cameras </p> 


<p> HomeKit is Apple's attempt to bring all your smart devices together into a single ecosystem. In Apple's future your smart dock-lock will talk to your smart lights, and your smart thermostat will be able to work seamlessly with your smart ceiling fan.                                                                              </p>

Now with iOS 10 , Apple is also allowing you to control all your HomeKit-supported devices through a single app.


<p> we live in a century where every information of the world be it the equators or the north or the south pole is just a few clicks or touches away .. and this is just a start whether we believe it or not technology is taking us in a completely new dimension a dimension where everything from our door locks to the thermostat to the lighting which we'd want to suit our mood would be a few touches away..                                                                                                                             </p>

<p>Most of our classrooms of today do not differ much from those of the 19th century, "chalk and talk, as well as desk and texts" are still the primary structure of classroom lessons as they were back then. But yet, ), today's curricula, together with societal demands, expects students to learn and know a lot more than previous generations. With time, technology increases rapidly and becomes more ubitquitous. 
somethings thats taken for granted quite is just the thing that without it may make us feel like its stone age and leave us frustrated..  </p>




<h3>Photography - The magic of Capturing every moment</h3>
<center><img src="C:\Users\user\Documents\HTML\photography.jpg"img align="left" width="750" height="450"><br></center>

<p> The idea for photographing came around in 1814 when Joseph Niépce wanted an image of his son before he left for war. He succeeded in making the first camera in 1827, but the camera needed at least eight hours to produce one picture. Parisian Louis Daguerre invented the next kind of camera in 1839, who worked with Niépce for four years. His camera only needed fifteen to thirty minutes to produce a picture. Both Niécpe’s and Daguerre’s cameras made pictues on metal plates.</p> 
<p>  In the same year Daguerre made his camera, an Englishman by the name of William Henry Fox Talbot made the first camera that photographed pictures on paper. The camera printed a reverse picture onto a negative and chemicals were needed to produce the photo up right. In 1861, color film came along and pictures were produced with color instead of being just black and white. James Clerk Maxwell is credited with coming up with color film, after he took the ...</p>

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.SS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.
