When people think about home automation, or a connected home, they tend to instantly think about the 
type of intelligent home that you see in the movies.That includes blinds or curtains being controlled
by a remote control, or a stunning hydraulic swimming pool ascending or descending from the floor via
a simple push of a button. All of those things have a place for those who can surround themselves with
luxuries that cost untold amounts of money, but for the rest of us, or the standard home-owners if you
will, there’s a growing market of hardware-based accessories that exist to not only make our lives
easier,but to also turn our homes into an intelligent living space that continuously gives us
information about how we are living.

1.August Smart Lock

If you haven’t heard of the August Smart Lock, then you really need to consider adopting it into your life. Often described as being like
 “a bouncer for smart homes”, the Smart Lock is essentially a replacement lock for your doors that negates the need for a physical key. Rather 
than having to carry around a set of keys, the August Smart Lock facilitates the creation and use of virtual keys for all family members and guests
 that are allowed access to a specific property. Virtual keys can be created easily, and access can even be granted using those keys for very 
specific dates and times, or even hours, days, or minutes.
<br>
One of the really exciting and interesting things about August’s Smart Lock – aside from the fact that it’s a Bluetooth-enabled lock that uses virtual keys
 – is that owners can actually use the accompanying August Home app to track all access to a property. Each virtual key can be assigned to an individual,
 meaning whenever it’s used, it’s logged in the app for the main home owner or app administrator to see the log. Have an Apple Watch? Then you have your
 own virtual key already on your wrist. How easy is that?

Canary is a simple, out-of-the-box security system that is perfect for those who want to keep an eye on their home remotely; it helps protect your house by 
alerting you of intrusions. The device itself comes with a camera to monitor your house surroundings, a humidity and air quality monitor and a siren that is
 good for chasing thieves away.

Canary is smart in its own way, as the device will learn your habits. It knows that when you’re home, it doesn’t have to alert you when the doors to your home
 is opened.

There seems to be a recent trend of having robotic assistants in the home, and while the Amazon Echo and Google Home offer conveniences for users, they lack an
 emotional impact that a more traditional robot solution does. The answer to this comes in the form of Kuri, a device created by Mayfield Robotics that was one
 of the most popular robots to be shown at CES 2017.  
<br>
Kuri is designed to help you around the house, but not in the way Amazon and Google are doing it. Instead this little robot, that measures up at 50 centimetres tall,
 is crammed full of technology to help differentiate itself from the less adorable house helpers on the market. Loudspeakers, microphones, a camera and sensors are
 just some of the technologies Kuri has inside itself.  
<br>
All of these technologies culminate to create a robot that can be useful in a ton of different situations — the robot can alert parents if their children have made 
it home from school and the camera can be used in conjunction with the Kuri smartphone application to allow users a glimpse inside their home when they’re away. This
 is the cutest mobile home camera on the market.
<br>

Kuri acts as your shadow, following you around the house, learning the interior of your home to make note of the quickest routes around it. The robot has been
designed to do more emotional tasks like read your children bedtime stories through audiobooks or play you a podcast while you get ready for work in the morning.
Kuri is currently available for pre-order and will retail for $699 (£575). You’ll be able to have this little robot following you around when it releases at the
end of 2017.
